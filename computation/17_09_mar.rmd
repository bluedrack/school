## Basics

* log
* function
  * injective
  * surjective
  * bijective
* radix representation


## RSA/SHA

* secure fingerprint E ZZ
* MD4(x) =< 2^12 key
* MD5(x) =< 2^128 throughout until 2008 break in sqr(2^128) = 2^64
* P of collision in a set of n is sqr(n)
* NSA made SHA (boost MD5 boost to 160) SHA0 bad
* SHA1 improved (Antoine Joux, understand diff between SHA0 SHA1 -> find exploit in MD5 2004)
* SHA2 =< 2^256
	* public competition -> SHA3 tot. diff SHA2

# Radix representation

* base n
